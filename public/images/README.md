# Images Directory

## Logo Placement

**Please place your `logo.png` file in this directory.**

The logo should be:
- Format: PNG (recommended) or SVG
- Recommended size: 36x36px to 128x128px
- File name: `logo.png` (or `logo.svg`)

### Current Structure:
```
public/
  images/
    logo.png  ← Place your logo here
```

The Header component will automatically load the logo from `/images/logo.png`. If the PNG is not found, it will fallback to `/hawkeye-logo.svg`.

## Other Assets

You can also place other images here:
- Hero section illustrations
- Dashboard mockups
- User avatars for social proof
- Feature icons
